# Approximation of Ray Object Intersection in the Case of Quadric Surfaces

The following illustration intends to aid your intuition concerning the intersection point calculation for rays. Quadrics in rayx have the origin \\((0, 0, 0)\\) in the object coordinate system. 

## Geometric Shape of Objects

Beamline objects in rayx can have the following shapes:

- Rectangle
- Ellipse

When we define the height and width of an object, we are defining the extent of these shapes - in the figure below, you can see an example of a rectangular shape.

Currently, we are calculating the intersection of a planar surface in the xz-plane and use this as an approximation for our quadric surface. You can see this approximation in the figure below. The points \\(A_1,B_1,C_1,D_1\\) form a plane which isn't curved, like the quadric is in this part.

This could lead to a reported hit (resp. miss) of the object, where there should be a miss (resp. hit).
