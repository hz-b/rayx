# Beamline Objects

In the following chapter, you will find extensive information on all the Beamline Objects supported by RAYX.

# Supported Objects

We divide the objects into two categories: Light Sources and Optical Elements. As the name suggests, the Light Sources are the objects that create the ray information, such as their starting position, the direction of the flight path, and the energy the ray is carrying.
